# Excellence in Agronomy - Carob

This contains the *carob* compliant scripts to standardize Excellence in Agronomy CGIAR initiative data. This is a separate repository in order to avoid risks of conflicts between the 2 repositories. For now, the datasets are not public, but once they are, they will be added to the main carob project.

For additional information on what is carob and how it is used, please visit [https://github.com/reagro/carob](https://github.com/reagro/carob) or the [carob-data website](https://carob-data.org/).
